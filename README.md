# Bird-Species
2010 pairs of images and labels. Images are 224 X 224 X 3 in jpg format. Labels are in Yolo format. There is only one class. The dataset was prepared so I could develop a model that would automate the process of cropping bird images downloaded from the internet. The resulting cropped images produced by the code was used to prepare a large share of the images in my Birds 500 species dataset located at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species. While the model isn't perfect at creating the bounding box the resulting cropped images are in most cases adequate.
